## Conversation Templates

Conversation Templates allow you to repeat the same prompts with different models. Templates can define variables for
use in the template title and prompt text (e.g., `{{var}}`).

There are two ways to create a template. Click "Add Template" from the index page, and a new template is created and
opened in the template editor. The other way is to click "Template" from a conversation view's menu.

Ollama Chat supports special **prompt commands** that allow you to include file and URL content in
your prompt, among other things. The following prompt commands are available:

- `/file` - include a file
